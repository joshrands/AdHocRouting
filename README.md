# Ad hoc Network Routing Protocol Implementations

### NASA SmallSat Project - Colorado School of Mines

Classes designed for physical implementation and simulated implementation of an ad-hoc network on a single decentralized subnet.

Author: Josh Rands

## To Do

### Bugs

0. Aodv's decodeReceivedPacket does not care about ports... if a data packet is sent with 0x01 as the first byte it will be classified as a RREQ message. 

### AODV 

AODV Protocol: https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3561.txt
[code here](aodv)

### SOCKET
[code here](socket)

### ADHOC-HARDWARE
[code here](hardware)

### AODV-REM
1. Add network monitoring 

### ns3 Simulation
1. Create a module with this aodv

## Running the code

This code is currently stand alone classes, but I added test.cc to so we can test while we develop. 

1. Clone this repository 
2. Using a terminal, type 'make clean-all & make all'
3. Code should compile and you can run ./do-adhoc to start doing ad hoc! 

I use Visual Studio Code to develop. It has a nice built in terminal. <- Cool story bro <<-- Thanks mayn

[better route vs duplicate?](aodv/aodv_rreq.cc:57)
